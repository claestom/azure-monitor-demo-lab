# Stage C — Alerts and response

> **Goal of this stage:** turn the lab from "observable" into "responsive." We add the Action Group (email + Logic App + optional SIEM webhook), a catalog of metric/log/activity alerts on the Stage B workloads, the AMBA baseline rule pack, resource/service health alerts, alert processing rules for routing/suppression, and a VMSS with predictive autoscale to demonstrate alert-to-action loops.
>
> **Maps to scenarios:** 7, 8, 12, 15, 17, 19, 23, 37.

## 1) What gets created

| Group | Resource(s) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Automitigation Logic App | `la-amlab-automitigate` | Generic HTTP-triggered Logic App. Its callback URL becomes a webhook receiver on the Action Group — proves "alert ⇒ workflow" end-to-end. |
| Action Group | `ag-amlab-email` | Receivers: 1 × email (`alertEmail` param), 1 × webhook (Logic App), and 0–1 × secure webhook for an external SIEM (`siemWebhookUrl` if non-empty). |
| Workload alerts (`alerts.bicep`) | Metric/log alerts on AKS, App Service, App Insights, Linux VM, Windows VM | Demonstrate the alert taxonomies: metric vs. log, static vs. dynamic threshold, single-resource vs. resource-graph scoped. |
| AMBA baseline | Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts rule set | The Microsoft-published "minimum viable monitoring" rule pack applied to VMs, web app, AKS, and App Service plan. |
| Health alerts | `health-alerts.bicep` | Service Health + Resource Health subscription-scope alerts. Demonstrates platform-impact alerting (planned maintenance, outages). |
| Alert processing rules | `apr-amlab-*` | Routing/suppression rules at the RG scope (e.g., suppress alerts at night, force-add the action group on all alerts in the RG). |
| VMSS | `vmss-amlab` (Standard_B1s, with predictive autoscale) | Tied into the alerting story — autoscale events surface in `AzureActivity` and become demo material in Stage D. |

> Cross-stage references: `law-amlab-central`, `appi-amlab`, `aks-amlab`, web app, app plan, both VMs are all `existing` references.

## 2) Speaker notes

1. **"One action group, many receivers."**
   Show the Action Group page: email + Logic App webhook + (optional) SIEM webhook. Customers usually have all three. Emphasise that an Action Group is the *receiver fan-out*, not the *router*.

2. **"Routing happens in *alert processing rules*."**
   Open an APR. Demonstrate add-action-group, suppression schedules. This is the right place to filter, not in 100 individual alerts.

3. **"AMBA is the floor, not the ceiling."**
   AMBA baseline gives a customer's `MTTD` story in 5 minutes. Show the rule list in `Monitor → Alerts → Alert rules`. Frame as: *"This is what you should always have on; everything else is workload-specific."*

4. **"Webhook = workflow."**
   Trigger a synthetic alert (e.g., stop the web app or push App Insights load). Show the Logic App run history light up. This is the moment customers see auto-mitigation isn't sci-fi.

5. **"Dynamic thresholds beat static thresholds for variable workloads."**
   Pick one dynamic-threshold alert from `alerts.bicep` and explain the *Smart Detection* learning window. Pair this with App Insights anomalies if time permits.

6. **"Predictive autoscale needs alerts too."**
   The VMSS is here on purpose — show that autoscale events emit `AzureActivity` rows and how alerts on those events drive change tracking.

7. **"Stage C is cheap; the cost is alert *fatigue*."**
   Cost-wise this stage adds nearly nothing (≤ €10/mo). The real cost is signal-to-noise. Use this slot to talk about *alert processing rules*, severity discipline, and on-call rotations.

## 3) Portal walkthrough (UI)

1. **`ag-amlab-email` → Receivers** — show email, Logic App webhook, optional SIEM webhook.
2. **Monitor → Alerts → Alert rules** — filter scope by RG; show the catalog. Sort by severity and signal type.
3. **Monitor → Alerts → Alert processing rules** — open one; show condition + actions + suppression window if present.
4. **`la-amlab-automitigate` → Runs history** — empty for now; will fill after the first test alert.
5. **`vmss-amlab` → Scaling** — show predictive autoscale enabled.
6. **AMBA rules** — search Alert rules for `AMBA` or `[AMBA]` prefix. Show the rule pack across resource types.
7. **Service Health → Health alerts** — show the subscription-scope rule pointed at our Action Group.
8. **Trigger a synthetic alert** — easiest: `az webapp stop -n <webapp> -g <rg>`, wait 5–10 min for the App Service availability/5xx alert (or the AMBA web app rule) to fire, observe email + Logic App run, then `az webapp start`.

## 4) CLI validation

```powershell
$sub = '<your-subscription-id>'
$rg  = 'rg-azure-monitor-lab-terraform-test'
az account set --subscription $sub

# Action group with receivers
az monitor action-group show -g $rg -n ag-amlab-email --query "{name:name,emailReceivers:emailReceivers[].emailAddress,webhookReceivers:webhookReceivers[].name}" -o json

# Logic App callback registered as webhook
az resource show -g $rg -n la-amlab-automitigate --resource-type Microsoft.Logic/workflows --query "{name:name,state:properties.state,trigger:properties.definition.triggers}" -o json

# Catalog of metric alerts and log search alerts
az monitor metrics alert list -g $rg --query "[].{name:name,severity:severity,enabled:enabled,scopes:scopes}" -o table
az monitor scheduled-query list -g $rg --query "[].{name:name,severity:properties.severity,enabled:properties.enabled}" -o table

# Activity log + health alerts (subscription scope)
az monitor activity-log alert list --query "[?contains(scopes[0], '$sub')].{name:name,enabled:enabled}" -o table

# Alert processing rules
az monitor alert-processing-rule list -g $rg --query "[].{name:name,enabled:properties.enabled,scopes:properties.scopes}" -o table

# VMSS + predictive autoscale
az vmss show -g $rg -n vmss-amlab --query "{name:name,sku:sku,capacity:sku.capacity}" -o table
az monitor autoscale list -g $rg --query "[].{name:name,enabled:enabled,predictiveAutoscalePolicy:predictiveAutoscalePolicy.scaleMode}" -o table

# Smoke test (no destructive intent — start it back up immediately)
$app = az webapp list -g $rg --query "[?starts_with(name, 'app-amlab')].name | [0]" -o tsv
az webapp stop -g $rg -n $app
# wait 5–10 minutes
az webapp start -g $rg -n $app
```

## 5) Done-when

1. `ag-amlab-email` has at least one email receiver and one webhook receiver.
2. Alerts list contains at least one metric, one log, one activity, and one AMBA rule.
3. At least one alert processing rule is present and enabled.
4. The Logic App's *Runs* page shows at least one successful run after a synthetic trigger.
5. The email receiver has received and acknowledged at least one alert during the session — best confidence-builder you can give the customer.
